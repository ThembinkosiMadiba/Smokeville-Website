## 💡 Common Questions

### **"Will I really not be charged with Option 1?"**
**Yes, really!** 

Your restaurant website will use:
- ~100 images = ~500MB storage
- ~100 visitors/day = ~50MB downloads/day

Free tier gives you:
- 5GB storage (10x more than you need)
- 1GB/day downloads (20x more than you need)

**You'd need 1,000+ visitors/day to be charged anything.**

---

### **"Is Option 2 less professional?"**
**Not really!**

Visitors won't know the difference. Images load from Imgur's CDN (very fast). It's just an extra step for YOU when uploading.

Big companies use CDNs like this. It works great!

---

### **"Can I switch later?"**
**Yes!**

Start with Option 2 (free URL approach).

When ready, enable Storage (Option 1).

Your existing images keep working. New uploads use Storage. Easy!

---

### **"Which do most restaurants choose?"**
**Option 1** (with Storage)

Because:
- Billing is free anyway
- Easier workflow
- More control
- Professional setup
- Worth the 8 minutes

But Option 2 works perfectly fine too!

---

## ⏰ Time Breakdown

### **Option 1 (Storage):**
- **Now:** 8 minutes setup
- **Per upload:** 10 seconds (click, select, done)
- **Total time:** ~8 minutes one-time

### **Option 2 (URLs):**
- **Now:** 2 minutes (I modify code)
- **Per upload:** 30 seconds (upload to Imgur, copy URL, paste)
- **Total time:** ~2 minutes now, +20s per image later

**Option 1 saves you time in the long run!**
